# Anscombe's Quartet I

In the second lab of the Metis data visualization course my group (group 1) was to visualize the 1st example of Anscombe's Quartet. Creating a scatter plot is all well and good, but I wanted to make things a little bit more interesting.

What's more interesting than a scatter plot, you might ask. Well, how about rainbow colors transitioning and random fluctuations in circle radii? No, this does not conform to data visualization best practices, but that's not what I was going for in this example.

You must know the rules, before you can break them.
